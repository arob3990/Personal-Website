                    My name is Alex Robertson and I'm an aspiring web-developer. On my 
                    webpage you can find links to projects that I've completed as well as 
                    links to my professional pages and contact pages.

                    As my portfolio grows, I will continue to update this page with new
                    projects and you will find links to them below.

        first picture is the only one that will currently do this as it's the only portfolio item at this time. 
        The other pictures are currently placeholders and will be changed and added upon as my portfolio grows. -->
